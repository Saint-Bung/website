          Roblox began development in 2003 by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel. Before the name of Roblox was finalized in January 2004, two other names – GoBlocks and DynaBlocks – were considered. During this time, it was also named Roblox v.10 according to DomainTools screenshots. Roblox came out of beta and was officially launched on September 1, 2006.

          Creating a Character
Now, in order to create the game character, you need to pick every character from the pre-developed characters, or if you are a premium member and a high-level developer, then you can create the characters.

But for Normal developers, predeveloped characters are there to pick from. However, you can change their apparels and their color. You can customize each and every aspect of character and objects that are already developed in the template.
